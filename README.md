# write-haiku
A simple site that teaches how to write a haiku providing inspiration from nature photography.

This website was developed as part of the Code Louisville 2021 Front End Web Development Course. The purpose of the site is two-fold: to get people to try writing a poem (maybe for the first time) and to show my photography in a format where people can interact with it. The design is meant to be simple and clean, like the style of a haiku, and to show off the images. 

On the first page, users learn what a haiku is. They then click the button in the body of the page or the link in the navigation menu to go to the "write a haiku" page where they 1) select a nature image to inspire their poem, and 2) write a poem in the input box, and 3) click submit to see their poem displayed under the image.

To view this project, the reviewer needs to click the button or navigation link on the home page to write a haiku, then they need to select an image, and finally they need to input the lines of their poem and click submit.

Features included:

1) Creating a responsive menu using Flexbox. 
2) Showing and hiding content areas using JavaScript and JQuery on the "write a haiku" page.
3) Creating a form where the user enters a poem, checking whether the user has entered something, and then displaying the poem back to the user (or a message that nothing was entered).
4) Creating an array of objects to store and display image gallery to the page.
