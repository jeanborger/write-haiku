# write-haiku
A simple site that teaches how to write a haiku providing inspiration from nature photography.

This website was developed as part of the Code Louisville 2021 Front End Web Development Course. The purpose of the site is two-fold: to get people to try writing a poem (maybe for the first time) and to show my photography in a format where people can interact with it. The design is meant to be simple and clean, like the style of a haiku, and to show off the images. 

On the first pages, users learn what a haiku is. They then click the button in the body or the link in the navigation menu to go to a page where they can 1) select a nature image to inspire their poem, and 2) write a poem in input boxes. When they click submit, their poem and the image they selected appear on the page.

To view this project, the reviewer needs to click the button or navigation link on the home page to write a haiku, then they need to select an image, and finally they need to input the lines of their poem.

Features included:

1) Creating a responsive menu using Flexbox. 
2) Showing and hiding content areas using JavaScript and JQuery on the "Write a Haiku" page.
3) Creating a form where the user can enter a poem, making sure the user has entered their input, and then displaying the poem back to the user.
4) Creating a JavaScript array
